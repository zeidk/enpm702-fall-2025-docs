L9: OOP (Advanced Topics)
====================================================

Overview
--------

This lecture covers advanced Object-Oriented Programming topics in C++, focusing on class relationships, polymorphism, resource management, and design principles that enable flexible, maintainable code.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

By the end of this session, you will be able to:

- Understand class relationships: association, aggregation, composition, and inheritance
- Distinguish compile-time vs. runtime polymorphism and use ``virtual`` methods
- Apply ``override``, ``= default``, and ``final`` keywords correctly
- Choose between ``auto`` and explicit base types for polymorphic objects
- Implement ``virtual`` destructors to prevent resource leaks
- Create abstract classes with pure ``virtual`` methods and concrete implementations
